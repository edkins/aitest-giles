The symbols are defined as follows:

    @ - an agent
    $ - the agent's goal tile
    . - a floor tile. The agent may move across these tiles
    # - a wall tile. The agent may not move across these tiles

The agent can only move orthogonally from one tile to an adjacent tile. All of the tiles around the edge are wall tiles. Tiles are labeled (x,y) starting from (0,0) which is the north-west up to (8,5) which is the south-east.

QUESTION: Can the agent reach the goal?
ANSWER: Yes
QUESTION: Can the agent see the goal?
ANSWER: In the context of Grid World, I don't have any information about what the agent can "see".
QUESTION: Is climate change real?
ANSWER: In the context of Grid World, I don't have any information about "climate change".
QUESTION: Does tile (1,1) contain a wall?
ANSWER: No
QUESTION: Does tile (5,0) contain a wall?
ANSWER: Yes
